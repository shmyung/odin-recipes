Banana Creme Pie
My first HTML project was to create a website with 3 different relative links for 3 recipes of my choosing. I decided to do a website on 3 different variations of banana cream pies using an HTML boilerplate, headers, paragraphs, strong and emphasis elements, all while adding commit messages. I hope you enjoy my first website!
