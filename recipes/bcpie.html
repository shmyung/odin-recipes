        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Sugar: The sweet banana cream pie filling starts with white sugar.</li>
            <li>Flour: All-purpose flour helps thicken the creamy filling.</li>
            <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make your pie taste salty.</li>
            <li>Milk: Two cups of milk lends moisture and thins the filling.</li>
            <li>Egg yolks: Three egg yolks help create a rich, decadent texture.</li>
            <li>Butter: Butter adds even more moisture and richness.</li>
            <li>Vanilla: A dash of vanilla enhances the overall flavor.</li>
            <li>Pie shell: Use a store-bought pastry crust or make your own at home. Some reviewers prefer using a graham cracker crust.</li>
            <li>Bananas: Of course, you'll need bananas! About four, to be exact.</li>
