        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>How to make a strawberry-banana cream pie with homemade pudding! One of the easiest and most satisfying desserts on Earth, this recipe is truly a treat for the Sam's to 
        enjoy for awhile.</p>
        <p>This Strawberry Banana Cream Pie is made with a buttery graham cracker crust, filled with a vanilla custard and bananas, chilled then topped with fresh strawberries before serving. Beautiful presentation and so scrumptious!</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Sugar: The sweet banana cream pie filling starts with white sugar.</li>
            <li>Flour: All-purpose flour helps thicken the creamy filling.</li>
            <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make your pie taste salty.</li>
            <li>Milk: Two cups of milk lends moisture and thins the filling.</li>
            <li>Egg yolks: Three egg yolks help create a rich, decadent texture.</li>
            <li>Butter: Butter adds even more moisture and richness.</li>
            <li>Vanilla: A dash of vanilla enhances the overall flavor.</li>
            <li>Pie shell: Use a store-bought pastry crust or make your own at home. Some reviewers prefer using a graham cracker crust.</li>
            <li>Bananas: Of course, you'll need bananas! About four, to be exact.</li>
            <li>Strawberries!</li>
        </ul>
